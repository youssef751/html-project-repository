    <td>Automation is precisely one of those double-edged swords of artificial intelligence. On the one hand, automation can improve productivity and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. It can make production more consistent. It can also free employees up to do more important things.</td>
    <td>Artificial intelligence, unless it is programmed to mimic human emotions, is free from the feelings that can interfere with human decision-making. Humans can be biased and let their emotions rule their head. AI can be immune to this problem</td>
    <td>Artificial intelligence has many applications in education. One of the most promising is individualized learning, or personalized learning, that creates and adapts learning paths to best suit the learning styles of the individual student.</td>
	<td>Granted, most of us would probably rather deal with a live human being when we need customer service or tech support from a company.
However, strategic use of artificial intelligence, such as in the form of the aforementioned catboats, can help reduce strain on busy customer service departments
</td>
	<td>As you probably know, online communities can be cesspools of trolls and flame wars. Online community moderation by artificial intelligence could potentially help make moderation of online forums, bulletin boards, comment sections, and social media sites easier.</td>
	<td>It all started with Apple’s Siri, the AI used on iPhones and other Apple devices to answer questions and interact with users. Then Microsoft got on board with their version called Cortana. Now Amazon’s AI, Alexa, is available in people’s homes through Echo devices and Fire tablets</td>
	<td>We are not quite at the point yet of all average boys and girls getting customizable robots and dolls powered by artificial intelligence in their Christmas stockings. However, we are getting close. Artificial intelligence has unlimited applications when it comes to creating engaging interactive toys and games for kids of all ages.</td>
	<td>Artificial intelligence has many applications when it comes to health and medicine. AI will be used to help improve medical diagnoses as well as patient care. While the human touch is still very important for helping sick people heal, having AI as a support to medical personnel could be a huge boon.</td>
	<td>Artificial intelligence can be used to process and analyze data more efficiently and effectively. It can also be used to create predictive models and algorithms to help look at potential outcomes of various trends or scenarios</td>
	<td>For a while there, it seemed like America’s passion for space exploration had died. However, with new and exciting commercial space programs in the works, we are likely to see a space gold rush coming soon</td>
